# Auth0 CLI Homebrew Formula

This repository contains the Homebrew formula to install the [Auth0 CLI](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli).

> Note: The CLI is currently in an experimental state and is not supported by Auth0. It has not had a complete security review, and we do not recommend using it to interact with production tenants.

### Installation

```sh
$ brew install auth0/auth0-cli/auth0
```

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional [username/password databases](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/database/custom-db).
* Add support for [linking different user accounts](https://auth0.com/docs/link-accounts) with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when, and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules/current).
